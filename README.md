# quasi-edit-distance
Implementation of quasi edit distance algorithm

In short: I read article [1] and realized that this piece of code could be useful to be checked. I am not in theoretical computer science (linguist by education, admin by profession), thus can't tell if it makes sense. However, I am pretty sure it's linear, not quadratic. Also, I am sure the algorithm itself could be optimized.

Use Perl version ("rast.pl"). I remember Python version ("rast.py") didn't work. Ten years passed since I finished those two programs. Six years passed since I created so called "baby-pos.py" and I think it's working.

Enjoy if you are enjoying doing things like that :) Feel free to contact me at millosh@gmail.com.
